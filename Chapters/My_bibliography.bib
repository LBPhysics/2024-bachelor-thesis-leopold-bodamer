    abstract = {We address routing of classical and quantum information over quantum network and show how to exploit chirality (directionality) to achieve nearly optimal and robust transport. In particular, we prove how continuous-time chiral quantum walks over a minimal graph are able to model directional transfer of information over a network. At first, we show how classical information, encoded onto an excitation localized at one vertex of a simple graph, may be sent to any other chosen location with nearly unit fidelity by tuning a single phase. Then, we prove that high-fidelity transport is also possible for coherent superpositions of states, i.e., for routing of quantum information. Furthermore, we show that by tuning the phase parameter, one obtains universal quantum routing, i.e., independent on the input state. In our scheme, chirality is governed by a single phase, and the routing probability is robust against fluctuations of this parameter. Finally, we address characterization of quantum routers and show how to exploit the self-energies of the graph to achieve high precision in estimating the phase parameter.},

  abstract={Quantum transport across discrete structures is a relevant topic that can be suitably studied in the context of continuous-time quantum walks. The addition of phase degrees of freedom, leading to chiral quantum walks, can also account for directional transport on graphs with loops. We discuss criteria for quantum transport and study the enhancement that can be achieved with chiral quantum walks on chain-like graphs, exploring different topologies for the chain units and optimizing over the phases. We select three candidate structures with optimal performances and we investigate their transport behaviour with Krylov reduction. While one of them can be reduced to a weighted line with minor couplings modulation, the other two are truly chiral quantum walks, with enhanced transport probability over long chain structures.},

Various new physical realizations of these phenomena are discussed, with a focus on their role for electronic transport and quantum dissipation in coupled nano-scale systems like quantum dots.

  abstract = {This essay presents a theoretical description of the superradiance phenomenon, in which both the quantal and the classical aspects are discussed. Starting from the simple two-level atom-small sample Dicke model, we successively introduce various complications inherent to a realistic superradiance experiment: effects of Van der Waals interaction between the atoms, propagation and diffraction of the electromagnetic field in the sample and finally the effects related to atomic level degeneracy or near degeneracy. We recall how to calculate the field radiated by a superradiant system in a single experiment and how to determine, for a series of identically prepared superradiant samples, the large shot to shot fluctuations of the emitted light properties. The presentation tries to unify various points of view and formalisms developed in previous works and to introduce simply and progressively the basic physical concepts relevant to the superradiance phenomenon.}

  abstract = {Publisher Summary. This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Boseâ€“Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.}

  abstract={Exceptional points (EPs), at which two or more eigenvalues and eigenstates of a resonant system coalesce, are associated with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with gain and/or loss elements. Dynamic encircling of EPs has received significant interest in recent years, as it has been shown to lead to highly nontrivial phenomena, such as chiral transmission in which the final state of the system depends on the encircling handedness. Previously, chiral transmission for a pair of eigenmodes has been realized by establishing a closed dynamical trajectory in parity-time- (PT-) or anti-PT-symmetric systems. Although chiral transmission of symmetry-broken modes, more accessible in practical photonic integrated circuits, has been realized by establishing a closed trajectory encircling EPs in anti-PT-symmetric systems, the demonstrated transmission efficiency is very low due to path-dependent losses. Here, we demonstrate chiral dynamics in a coupled waveguide system that does not require a closed trajectory. Specifically, we explore an open trajectory linking two infinite points having the same asymptotic eigenmodes (not modes in PT- and anti-PT-symmetric systems), demonstrating that this platform enables high-efficiency chiral transmission, with each eigenmode localized in a single waveguide. This concept is experimentally implemented in a coupled silicon waveguide system at telecommunication wavelengths. Our work provides a new evolution strategy for chiral dynamics with superior performance, laying the foundation for the development of practical chiral-transmission devices.}

    abstract = "{Dense atom ensembles with Rydberg excitations display intriguing collective effects mediated by their strong, long-range dipoleâ€“dipole interactions. These collective effects, often modeled using Rydberg superatoms, have gained significant attention across various fields due to their potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum optics. In this review article, we delve into the theoretical foundations of Rydberg interactions and explore experimental techniques for their manipulation and detection. We also discuss the latest advancements in harnessing Rydberg collective effects for quantum computation and optical quantum technologies. By synthesizing insights from theoretical studies and experimental demonstrations, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field and its potential impact on the future of quantum technologies.}",
